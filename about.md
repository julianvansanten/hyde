# About me

I am a Bachelor Technical Computer Science student at the University of Twente. I have been playing around with technology ever since I was a kid and my interests for computers slowly started to grow.
I was playing with electrical circuits as a child, and I learnt an awful lot from my dad who taught me a lot about electrics. He is also in the business of CCTV systems, so that was a gateway for me to learn about networking.
After playing around with Minecraft servers as a kid and helping my dad with CCTV networks, I became more and more indulged in networking.
I learnt how interaction with the web worked in high school and I immediately knew that I wanted to study Computer Science.
